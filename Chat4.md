Certainly! As a Senior Product Manager, I have analyzed the provided `PDS_2239_Nilesh_Modi.docx` (which, based on the context and your workspace, is a Product Design/Specification Document for the Calorie Tracker app). While the actual DOCX content is binary and not directly readable here, you have also provided a comprehensive `psd.md` file, which appears to be the Markdown version of the PSD. I will use this as the basis for my analysis, as it is fully accessible and likely mirrors the DOCX content.

- **Deployment Topology:**
  - All services (Frontend, Backend, Mock Service) are containerized and orchestrated via Docker Compose.
  - The Backend connects to a local SQLite database for persistence.
  - The Frontend communicates with the Backend and Mock Service via REST APIs.
  - Google OAuth is used for authentication and is accessed by both Frontend and Backend.

- **Component Responsibilities:**
  - **Frontend:** User interface, authentication flow, meal CRUD, chart visualization, theme toggle, error handling.
  - **Backend:** API endpoints, authentication, user/session management, calorie data storage, test data generation.
  - **Mock Service:** Handles image analysis requests for demo purposes (not production).
  - **Database:** Stores user and calorie entry data.
  - **Google OAuth:** Provides secure authentication and user identity verification.
