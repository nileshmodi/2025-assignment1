Thank you for providing the codebase and the guidelines for the AI Challenge Series. To prepare a thorough and high-quality Product Specification Document (PSD) that meets the expectations outlined, I will need to clarify several points with you before proceeding. This will ensure the PSD is accurate, complete, and tailored to your intended product vision.

Below are my questions, grouped by the key PSD sections. Please answer as many as possible, or indicate if you want me to infer from the codebase where appropriate.

---

## 1. Product Overview & Purpose

- **What is the primary goal of this product?**
  - Is it intended for personal use, enterprise, or a specific audience (e.g., fitness enthusiasts, healthcare providers)?
Ans : It is intended for personal use, it's web based application.
- **What problem does it solve, and what is the main value proposition?**
Ans : Refer from the codebase.
- **Are there any unique selling points or differentiators compared to other calorie trackers?**
Ans : Refer from the codebase.


---

## 2. Scope

- **What are the boundaries of this product?**
  - Are there features you plan to add in the future that are out of scope for this version?
Ans : Currently we are not planning of adding any features. Analyse the current features from codebase.
- **Are there any integrations (e.g., with wearables, other health apps) planned or desired?**
Ans : Refer from the codebase.


---

## 3. Functional Requirements

- **Are there any features not yet implemented in the codebase that you want included in the PSD?**
Ans : NO.
- **Should the PSD cover only what is present in the code, or also planned/desired features?**
Ans : ONLY what is present in the codebase.
- **Are there any restrictions or business rules (e.g., daily calorie limits, user roles) that should be highlighted?**
Ans : STRICTLY FOLLOW the rules already set.

---

## 4. User Stories

- **Who are the main user personas?**
  - (e.g., Regular user, Admin, Guest, Nutritionist)
Ans : Not any specific type, it's for any type of user for user's diet/calorie plan.
- **Are there any specific user journeys or scenarios you want emphasized?**
Ans : Refer from the codebase.
- **Should user stories include edge cases (e.g., failed login, unauthorized access)?**
Ans : YES, as per the implemented codebase.

---

## 5. Non-Functional Requirements

- **What are your expectations for performance, scalability, and reliability?**
  - (e.g., “Support 1,000 concurrent users with <2s response time”)
Ans : Refer from the codebase.
- **Are there any security, privacy, or compliance requirements?**
  - (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA, data encryption)
Ans : Refer from the codebase.
- **What are the supported platforms and browsers?**
Ans : Any browsers.
- **Are there any accessibility requirements?**
Ans : Accessible to anyone.

---

## 6. Diagrams & Data Models

- **Do you want UML diagrams, ER diagrams, or both?**
Ans : BOTH if required as per the codebase.
- **Should the diagrams be high-level (system architecture) or detailed (class/entity relationships)?**
Ans : BOTH high-level (system architecture) and detailed (class/entity relationships) if applicable as per codebase.
- **Are there any specific workflows or sequences you want visualized (e.g., login flow, calorie entry process)?**
Ans : Refer from the codebase.

---

## 7. Change Log

- **Should the change log start from the current codebase, or do you want to include a history of major changes if available?**
Ans : From current codebase.
- **How detailed should the change log be (e.g., every commit, only major features)?**
Ans : Only major features.

---

## 8. Additional Considerations

- **Are there any branding, UI/UX, or design guidelines to be included?**
Ans : Refer from the codebase.
- **Should the PSD include references to specific files or line numbers for traceability?**
Ans : Not Required.
- **Is there a preferred structure or template for the PSD, or should I use the standard one outlined in your rules?**
Ans : YES, refer C:\Users\NileshMo\Downloads\codebase\psdFormat.md file for the template.

### Next Steps

Once you provide answers or clarifications to the above, I will:
- Confirm the active section to work on (per your rules).
- Begin extracting and structuring requirements, user stories, and diagrams as per your preferences.
- Ask follow-up questions if any ambiguity remains.
