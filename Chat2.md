Act as a Senior Software Architect and analyze the the attached code and the below attached guidelines and ask me all the neccessary questions to prepare an indepth PSD document in desired manner :

 AI Challenge Series ‚Äì Event #1
 From Code to Clarity ‚Äì Generate a Product Spec with AI
Overviewüß≠
Welcome to the first event of the AI Challenge Series!
This is an open, individual challenge where participants will use AI tools to generate a Product
Specification Document (PSD) from a provided codebase.
A Product Specification Document (PSD) is a clear, structured document that defines what a product is,
what it should do, and how it should behave. It acts as a bridge between stakeholders (like product
owners, designers, developers, and testers) to ensure everyone understands the product‚Äôs purpose,
scope, and requirements.
ObjectiveüéØ
‚Ä¢ Use AI tools (like ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, etc.) to understand the given codebase.
‚Ä¢ Generate a clear, complete, and correct Product Specification Document (PSD).
‚Ä¢ Prepare a write-up of your AI journey to the solution. (How you used AI. What prompts you used.)
‚Ä¢ Submit your PSD and the journey write-up to complete your participation.
Challenge Timeline ‚è≥
‚Ä¢ Start Date: 11th July 2025 @ 6pm
‚Ä¢ End Date: 21st July 2025
‚Ä¢ Duration: 10 days
Small, consistent effort daily is encouraged!
Participation Guidelines üìã
‚Ä¢ Open to all Talentica employees & Contractors ‚Äì No registration needed.
‚Ä¢ Individual participation only ‚Äì No teams.
‚Ä¢ Submit your PSD in docx (MS Word) format
o PSD_[employee-code]_[firstname]_[lastname].docx
Example: PDS_965_John_Doe.docx
‚Ä¢ Submit your write-up in docx (MS Word) format
o Journey_[employee-code]_[firstname]_[lastname].docx
Example: Journey_965_John_Doe.docx
‚Ä¢ Upload your submission here:
 https://forms.office.com/r/FewZXkKhvJ
What You‚Äôll Receive
‚Ä¢ A runnable codebase.
‚Ä¢ Instructions on how to run and explore the app will be in the codebase.
‚Ä¢ You are encouraged to use any AI tool to analyse and extract product-level understanding.
Evaluation Criteriaüìä
 Includes but not limited to
‚Ä¢ Product Overview & Purpose
‚Ä¢ Functional Requirements
‚Ä¢ User Stories
‚Ä¢ Non-Functional Requirements
Communication & Announcements
‚Ä¢ Exciting prizes for winners will be announced via Yammer within a few days post event.

Requirements :
1. Need to generate a complete Product Specification Document (PSD) in .docx format, covering at minimum the product overview, functional requirements, user stories, and non‚Äëfunctional requirements and Diagrams, Data Models, Change Log will add more values to the document.

DO NOT write the psd untill I specify.

**Cursor**

Thank you for providing the codebase and the guidelines for the AI Challenge Series. To prepare a thorough and high-quality Product Specification Document (PSD) that meets the expectations outlined, I will need to clarify several points with you before proceeding. This will ensure the PSD is accurate, complete, and tailored to your intended product vision.

Below are my questions, grouped by the key PSD sections. Please answer as many as possible, or indicate if you want me to infer from the codebase where appropriate.

---

## 1. Product Overview & Purpose

- **What is the primary goal of this product?**
  - Is it intended for personal use, enterprise, or a specific audience (e.g., fitness enthusiasts, healthcare providers)?
- **What problem does it solve, and what is the main value proposition?**
- **Are there any unique selling points or differentiators compared to other calorie trackers?**

---

## 2. Scope

- **What are the boundaries of this product?**
  - Are there features you plan to add in the future that are out of scope for this version?
- **Are there any integrations (e.g., with wearables, other health apps) planned or desired?**

---

## 3. Functional Requirements

- **Are there any features not yet implemented in the codebase that you want included in the PSD?**
- **Should the PSD cover only what is present in the code, or also planned/desired features?**
- **Are there any restrictions or business rules (e.g., daily calorie limits, user roles) that should be highlighted?**

---

## 4. User Stories

- **Who are the main user personas?**
  - (e.g., Regular user, Admin, Guest, Nutritionist)
- **Are there any specific user journeys or scenarios you want emphasized?**
- **Should user stories include edge cases (e.g., failed login, unauthorized access)?**

---

## 5. Non-Functional Requirements

- **What are your expectations for performance, scalability, and reliability?**
  - (e.g., ‚ÄúSupport 1,000 concurrent users with <2s response time‚Äù)
- **Are there any security, privacy, or compliance requirements?**
  - (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA, data encryption)
- **What are the supported platforms and browsers?**
- **Are there any accessibility requirements?**

---

## 6. Diagrams & Data Models

- **Do you want UML diagrams, ER diagrams, or both?**
- **Should the diagrams be high-level (system architecture) or detailed (class/entity relationships)?**
- **Are there any specific workflows or sequences you want visualized (e.g., login flow, calorie entry process)?**

---

## 7. Change Log

- **Should the change log start from the current codebase, or do you want to include a history of major changes if available?**
- **How detailed should the change log be (e.g., every commit, only major features)?**

---

## 8. Additional Considerations

- **Are there any branding, UI/UX, or design guidelines to be included?**
- **Should the PSD include references to specific files or line numbers for traceability?**
- **Is there a preferred structure or template for the PSD, or should I use the standard one outlined in your rules?**

---

### Next Steps

Once you provide answers or clarifications to the above, I will:
- Confirm the active section to work on (per your rules).
- Begin extracting and structuring requirements, user stories, and diagrams as per your preferences.
- Ask follow-up questions if any ambiguity remains.

**Please review and respond to these questions. This will ensure your PSD is comprehensive, accurate, and tailored to your needs.**
